# Current milestone

Milestone 003: oracle compositor and lifetime transfer positive control.

# Completed

- Initialized the Git repository and Python package.
- Implemented deterministic random residual primitives.
- Implemented programs, opaque task IDs, unique task generation, and fixed
  train/evaluation datasets.
- Added world validity diagnostics for output scale and saturation.
- Added a NumPy scratch residual MLP and examples-to-criterion experiment.
- Added unit tests for determinism, uniqueness, opacity, shapes, and metrics.
- Passed the initial test suite and smoke experiment.
- Ran the 64-task seed-0 scratch control: median final NMSE 0.0742, final-NMSE
  task-index correlation -0.0963, output variance range 0.2129–0.2284, and zero
  saturation.
- Prepared the verified foundation as the initial Git checkpoint.
- Installed PyTorch 2.13 for the oracle and subsequent learned models.
- Tuned the scratch control to learning rate 0.001 with four updates per example.
- Completed scratch controls on world seeds 0–2. Final-NMSE/task-index
  correlations were -0.060, 0.002, and -0.039; all tasks reached NMSE 0.1 at
  support 64, confirming no task-order difficulty trend at that resolution.

# In progress

- Implement the oracle compositor using true hidden routes and shared learned
  operator slots.

# Next

- Verify declining oracle late-life learning cost and novel-composition transfer.
- Implement matched dense and continuous reusable-basis learners.

# Decisions

- V1 starts with exact reuse (`rho = 1.0`). The reuse continuum follows only
  after the oracle and at least one learned reusable substrate work.
- Fixed arrays are part of a generated `World`, preventing accidental data-stream
  differences between paired models.
- The scratch validity gate uses NMSE 0.1 and continuous final error for now;
  NMSE 0.05 is fully censored by the current shallow scratch architecture and
  remains a sensitivity target rather than hidden or discarded evidence.
