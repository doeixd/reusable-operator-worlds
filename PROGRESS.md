# Current milestone

Milestones 004–005: matched dense baseline and continuous reusable operation
basis.

# Completed

- Initialized the Git repository and Python package.
- Implemented deterministic random residual primitives.
- Implemented programs, opaque task IDs, unique task generation, and fixed
  train/evaluation datasets.
- Added world validity diagnostics for output scale and saturation.
- Added a NumPy scratch residual MLP and examples-to-criterion experiment.
- Added unit tests for determinism, uniqueness, opacity, shapes, and metrics.
- Passed the initial test suite and smoke experiment.
- Ran the 64-task seed-0 scratch control: median final NMSE 0.0742, final-NMSE
  task-index correlation -0.0963, output variance range 0.2129–0.2284, and zero
  saturation.
- Prepared the verified foundation as the initial Git checkpoint.
- Installed PyTorch 2.13 for the oracle and subsequent learned models.
- Tuned the scratch control to learning rate 0.001 with four updates per example.
- Completed scratch controls on world seeds 0–2. Final-NMSE/task-index
  correlations were -0.060, 0.002, and -0.039; all tasks reached NMSE 0.1 at
  support 64, confirming no task-order difficulty trend at that resolution.
- Implemented the true-route oracle with six shared learned operator slots,
  predict-before-update scoring, completed-task replay, fixed support evaluation,
  model serialization, and unseen-composition testing.
- Confirmed oracle transfer on world seeds 0–2 and reversed seed 0. Across these
  runs, first-quarter mean examples to NMSE 0.05 ranged from 8.75 to 28.06 and
  fell to zero in the last quarter; examples to NMSE 0.02 ranged from 62.25 to
  96.38 and also fell to zero.
- On seed 0, zero-shot NMSE fell from 0.0345 in the first quarter to 0.00192 in
  the last quarter; unseen-composition zero-shot NMSE was 0.00215.
- Added functional primitive recovery. Seed-0 learned slots matched all six
  teacher primitives with mean normalized distance 0.000539.

# In progress

- Design matched dense and continuous-basis learners on the same lifetime
  protocol without exposing hidden routes.

# Next

- Implement and tune the dense baseline with opaque task embeddings.
- Implement the continuous reusable basis as the first non-oracle reuse model.
- Compare paired cumulative prequential cost, examples-to-criterion, retained
  state, parameter counts, and frozen-library novel-composition adaptation.

# Decisions

- V1 starts with exact reuse (`rho = 1.0`). The reuse continuum follows only
  after the oracle and at least one learned reusable substrate work.
- Fixed arrays are part of a generated `World`, preventing accidental data-stream
  differences between paired models.
- The scratch validity gate uses NMSE 0.1 and continuous final error for now;
  NMSE 0.05 is fully censored by the current shallow scratch architecture and
  remains a sensitivity target rather than hidden or discarded evidence.
- The oracle gate passed. NMSE 0.1 is too loose for oracle initialization, so
  oracle transfer claims use the stricter thresholds and zero-shot behavior.
